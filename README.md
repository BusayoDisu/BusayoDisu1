### PROJECT TITLE: Edmonton City Food Drive Project

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to optimize the food drive process in Edmonton City for more efficient and impactful donation management.

### Problem Statement

The current food donation management system in Edmonton faces challenges in coordinating drop-off locations, pick-up processes, and route planning. There is a need to automate and optimize these processes to ensure timely collection of donations and minimize logistical complexities.

### Solution
Efficiency Monitoring System:

To develop a machine learning system to continuously monitor the efficiency of the overall donation collection process. This could include monitoring route efficiency, volunteer performance, and resource utilization. Linear Regression and Random Forest models were used.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Dataset:

This folder contains the dataset used for the project. It includes information on donation locations, quantities, and other relevant parameters.

Notebooks:

This folder contains the source code for loading, cleaning, manipulation, visualization, analysis of the data collected, and the machine learning models

Presentations and Reports:

This folder houses the results of the project, including data visualizations, model outputs, and key performance metrics.
Others:

Miscellaneous files:

This folder houses other documents such as meeting notes, project timeline, and any other relevant information.
