### PROJECT TITLE: Predictive Modeling of Mental Health Conditions among University Students

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and understand mental health conditions based on demographic and academic information.

### Problem Statement

The increasing prevalence of mental health challenges among university students poses a significant concern. The absence of a systematic approach to understanding the intricate relationships between demographic, academic, and mental health variables hampers the development of effective preventive measures

### Solution

By interpreting model outcomes, the project aims to offer tailored recommendations for universities to implement proactive and effective intervention strategies.
