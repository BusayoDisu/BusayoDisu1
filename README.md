### PROJECT TITLE: Predictive Modeling of Academic Performance among University Students
Welcome to my personal project.

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and understand students' academic performance based on demographic and mental health information.

### Problem Statement

In a diverse educational setting, understanding the factors that influence students' academic performance, as measured by Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), is crucial for educators, administrators, and policymakers. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate students' CGPA based on various demographic and psychological features.

### Solution

By interpreting model outcomes, the project aims to offer tailored recommendations for universities to implement proactive and effective intervention strategies.
